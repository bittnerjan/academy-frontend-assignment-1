          HBO’s The Last of Us series will adapt dialogue from original game
          while deviating greatly in story for some episodes
        </h1>

        <p>
          Last year, it was announced that HBO and PlayStation Productions were
          adapting the hit PlayStation video game The Last of Us into a
          television series, and now, game director Neil Druckmann has offered
          an update on the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview with IGN during SXSW 2021, Druckmann revealed that the
          upcoming HBO series will adapt dialogue from the first The Last of Us
          game but will “deviate greatly” from the original story in some
          episodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Things sometimes stay pretty close. It’s funny to see my dialogue
          there from the games in HBO scripts. And sometimes they deviate
          greatly to much better effect because we are dealing with a different
          medium.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Druckmann later added: “HBO’s been great in pushing us to move away
          from hardcore action and focus more on the drama of the character.
          Some of my favourite episodes so far have deviated greatly from the
          story, and I can’t wait for people to see them.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The Last of Us is “set 20 years after modern civilization has been
          destroyed and centres on the relationship between Joel, a smuggler in
          this new world, and Ellie, a teenager who may be key to a cure for a
          deadly pandemic. Joel, a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle the
          14-year-old girl out of an oppressive quarantine zone. What starts as
          a small job soon becomes a brutal, heartbreaking journey as they
          traverse the U.S. and depend on each other for survival.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Craig Mazin, the creator of HBO’s acclaimed limited series Chernobyl,
          will pen the script and serve as executive producer on the TV
          adaptation alongside Neil Druckmann, the writer and creative director
          of the game. Beanpole director Kantemir Balagov will direct the pilot
          with Pedro Pascal (The Mandalorian) and Bella Ramsey (Game of Thrones)
          being cast as Joel and Ellie respectively.
