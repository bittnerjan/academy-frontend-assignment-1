          Jamie Foxx to Play Mike Tyson in Limited Series With Antoine Fuqua,
          Martin Scorsese Onboard
        </h1>

        <p>
          Jamie Foxx will play boxing great Mike Tyson in a new biographical
          limited series, Variety has learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The series, titled simply “Tyson,” is not currently set up at a
          network or streaming service, but will no doubt find one quickly given
          the names attached to it already. Antoine Fuqua is onboard to direct
          and executive produce via Fuqua Films, with Martin Scorsese also
          executive producing via Sikelia Productions.
        </p>
        <p>The series is said to span the whole of Tyson’s life.</p>
        <p>
          <b>“I have been looking to tell my story for quite some time,”</b>
          Tyson said.
          <b
            >“With the recent launch of Legends Only League and the excitement
            from fans following my return to the ring, now feels like the
            perfect moment. I look forward to collaborating with Martin,
            Antoine, Jamie, and the entire creative team to bring audiences a
            series that not only captures my professional and personal journey
            but also inspires and entertains.”</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Colin Preston wrote the the pilot for “Tyson” and is currently working
          on writing the full series. Foxx will executive produce in addition to
          starring. Along with Fuqua and Scorsese, Tyson and his wife, Kiki
          Tyson, will executive produce along with Sophie Watts and John Ryan
          Jr. on behalf of Tyson’s Legends Only League. Rick Yorn of LBI
          Entertainment will also executive produce. Azim Spicer of Legends Only
          League will serve as associated producer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foxx has been discussing his involvement in a Tyson project for some
          time, stating last year that he was deep into training for the role,
          though at the time it was said to be a biopic rather than a series.

          This is the second Tyson limited series announced in the past month.
          Hulu previously announced that it had ordered an eight-episode limited
          series about the boxer, but Tyson came out strongly against that
          series when it was announced and said he was not involved in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tyson made worldwide headlines when he became the youngest ever
          heavyweight champion in boxing history in 1986 at the age of 20. He
          remained a major force in boxing for years and is widely considered
          one of the greatest heavyweight fighters of all time. But his life
          outside the ring attracted perhaps even more attention, with Tyson
          becoming infamous for his wild exploits. He was also accused of
          serious mental and physical abuse by his wife, Robin Givens, and was
          convicted of rape in 1992, ultimately serving less than three years in
          prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has made a comeback of sorts in recent years, appearing in projects
          like “The Hangover” film franchise as himself and performing in a one
          man show on Broadway. He has also been open about his struggles with
          mental illness and substance abuse. Most recently, Tyson fought an
          eight round exhibition fight against Roy Jones Jr. in November, which
          ended in a draw. The event served as the launch of the Legends Only
          League.
