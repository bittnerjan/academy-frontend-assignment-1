        <p>
          Forest Whitaker has joined Tom Hardy in the upcoming Netflix crime
          drama film “Havoc,” Variety has learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film hails from writer, director, and producer Gareth Evans, the
          first under a new exclusive multi-year deal to produce and direct
          films for the streamer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In “Havoc,” after a drug deal gone wrong, a bruised detective must
          fight his way through a criminal underworld to rescue a politician’s
          estranged son, while unraveling a deep web of corruption and
          conspiracy that ensnares his entire city. Hardy’s casting was reported
          in February.

        />
        <p>
          Whitaker won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor for his
          portrayal of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in “The Last King of Scotland.”
          He has turned in tour de force performances in a number of other
          films, including but not limited to “Ghost Dog: The Way of the
          Samurai,” “The Butler,” “Black Panther,” “Platoon,” “Bird,” and “The
          Great Debaters.” He currently stars in the Epix series “Godfather of
          Harlem” as legendary gangster Ellsworth “Bumpy” Johnson. The second
          season of the show will debut in April.
        </p>
        <p>Whitaker is repped by WME and Brillstein Entertainment Partners.</p>
        <p>
          Evans is producing “Havoc” under his One More One Productions banner.
          Ed Talfan of Severn Screen will also produce, as will Aram Tertzakian
          for XYZ Films. Hardy will produce in addition to starring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evans is best known for writing and directing the action spectaculars
          “The Raid: Redemption” and its sequel. He most recently co-created the
          Sky-AMC series “Gangs of London,” which was renewed for a second
          season last year.
