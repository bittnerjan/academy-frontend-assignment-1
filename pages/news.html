                Jamie Foxx will play boxing great Mike Tyson in a new
                biographical limited series, Variety has learned. The series,

                names attached to it already. Antoine Fuqua is onboard to direct
                and executive produce via Fuqua Films, with Martin Scorsese also
                executive producing via Sikelia Productions. The series is said
                to span the whole of Tyson’s life. “I have been looking to tell
                my story for quite some time,” Tyson said. “With the recent
